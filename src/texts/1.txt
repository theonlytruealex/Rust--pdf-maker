What's something you're looking forward to doing?
Alex:^
On Monday we're shooting a short film in LA with Jakob (one of my friends from art school) and Rachel â€” she's a professional filmmaker. I've actually been writing this script for the last few months in quarantine, so I'm super excited to finally bring it to life!
Maria:^
Labor Day is this weekend and we're getting away to lake up by Acadia National Park. Mari and Tom are coming too, we haven't seen them in months!
