Shout-Outs

S/O to Alex for acing his exam! ðŸ’ª Also, thanks Dad for helping me fix my car over the phone. Don't know what I would have done without your help!
Yuna:^
Mostly continuing to think about my holistic healing and how to exercise more often. Easy for me to sit and watch a movie after a long day instead of going for a walk. Iâ€™m thinking about trying out yogaâ€¦ any recommendations on good online teachers?
