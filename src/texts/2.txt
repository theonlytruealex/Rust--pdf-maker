One Good Thing
lmao:^
I've been going on daily phone walks with mom. We walk and talk for about an hour and it's felt super connecting! If anyone else wants to do something like this, let me know :)
I've also been spending a lot more time reading during my vacation. I *love* it and have forgotten how invigorating it is to simply have endless space to read, reflect and write. Along with the walks, that's been a huge boost to my mood.
Rob:^
Shout out to everyone! I love this family.
Alex:^
Mom for giving me good advice on how I can talk to my roommate about doing dishes and keeping our place clean.
Yuna:^
So many! I have to say that a special shout out goes to Alex for significantly improving in school, Alice for her hard work, and Rob for being the best life partner!
